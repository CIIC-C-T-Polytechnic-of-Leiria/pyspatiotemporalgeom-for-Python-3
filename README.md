# *pyspatiotemporalgeom* library for Python 3

Converting the pyspatiotemporalgeom library to be compliant with Python 3 🐍.

🛠️ **Work in progress**🛠️ 

Description:
-----------

>"An open source geometry processing library focusing on regions and moving regions. Algorithms for constructing regions, identifying connected components, creating moving regions, and performing operations on moving regions are included. Some 3D operations are included, such as triangle/triangle intersection and ray/triangle intersection. In general, a regions is represented as a list of segments; a moving region is represented as a list of triangles."
